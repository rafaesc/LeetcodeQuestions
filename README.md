# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to LeetCode problems, all implemented in **JavaScript**. It's designed to track my progress, deepen my understanding of algorithms and data structures, and serve as a resource for others studying similar topics.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

- Each problem is organized in its own folder or file, named with the problem number and title.
- All solutions are written in clean and modern JavaScript (ES6+).

## âœ… Goals

- Improve my problem-solving skills through consistent practice  
- Write efficient and readable JavaScript code  
- Maintain a well-organized archive of solved problems  
- Choose a pattern and go deep on it. Solve 5â€“10 problems per pattern, focusing on understanding why the pattern works. (I can memorize it too, but in the long run, I'm more likely to forget unless I truly understand it.)


## ðŸ“Œ Note

This repository is updated regularly as I solve new challenges on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/).
